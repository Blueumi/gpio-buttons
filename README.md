# gpio-buttons

Work in progress for a GPIO button plugin for volumio2. Uses node js library 'onoff'.

Currently 5 actions can be attached to gpio pins: Play/pause, Vol+, Vol-, Next track and Previous track.

Zip for install in volumio2 is found here: http://tomatpasser.dk/gpio-buttons.zip

#Objective
- Buttons attached to pins
- Each button can control any part of the player
- Intuitive settings for coupling gpio pin to action
